= what is this?
this project is just a POC/prototype to see if you can develop a vintage story mod with F#. there is not much depth to it *but* as soon as this project is all worked out its possible to at least create a template for devs who prefer modding in F# instead of C#.

== FIRST OFF:
*this project was created with visual studio code.* +
keep this in the back of your mind before you proceed to experiment with this repo.

== CURRENT STATUS:
current status as of 25. feb. 2024:

the code compiles and you can launch debug the code. BUT as soon as you load into a world and look into the logs folder you will see *runtime exceptions* occuring.

*the generated DLLs do not recognize the defined type in vintagestoryModSystem.fs as being as subtype of ModSystem.*
